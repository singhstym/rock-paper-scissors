# rock-paper-scissors

This is my implementation of the famous Rock, Paper and Scissors game. Doing this project has helped me in learning the basics of Javascript language such as variables, data types, conditional statements, loops and arrays. The game currently only works in the browser console but I plan to implement a GUI for it soon.
